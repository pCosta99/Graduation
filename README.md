# Graduation
Collection of projects and repositories that I made through the completion of my graduation in software engineering.

## Fast Index

- First Year
    - [Computer Labs II](https://github.com/pCosta99/Graduation/tree/main/FirstYear/LI2) - A small game based on Tic Tac Toe and Sudoku using mostly HTML for frontend, generated with C (reading this 3 years later makes me laugh, hard).

- Second Year
    - [Computer Labs III](https://github.com/pCosta99/Graduation/tree/main/SecondYear/LI3) - A sales management system made in C and, similarly, in Java. Mostly a first glance at efficient use of data structures.
    - [Operative Systems](https://github.com/pCosta99/Graduation/tree/main/SecondYear/SO) - Also sales management but in a client-server fashion.
    - :heart: [Program Calculation](https://github.com/pCosta99/Graduation/tree/main/SecondYear/CP) :heart: - Higher recursion schemes in a pointfree style and all the bases needed towards that, also known as, when I found a purpose in my life. :joy:
    - [Objected Oriented Programming](https://github.com/pCosta99/Graduation/tree/main/SecondYear/POO) - A Uber-like application developed in Java.

- Third Year
    - [Databases](https://github.com/pCosta99/Graduation/tree/main/ThirdYear/FirstSemester/BD) - Relational and non-relational databases. Project involved designing and implementing a model for a gym in a college.
    - [Software Systems Development](https://github.com/pCosta99/Graduation/tree/main/ThirdYear/FirstSemester/DSS) - A Spotify-like application made in Java with a GUI made using JavaFX. Used [UML](https://www.uml.org) in a first phase with the objective of modeling our design and only program it after all planning.
    - [Distributed Systems](https://github.com/pCosta99/Graduation/tree/main/ThirdYear/FirstSemester/SD) - SoundCloud-like application made in Java. It used TCP sockets and the client-server paradigm to create a multi-client application.
    - [Numeric Methods and Non-Linear Optimization](https://github.com/pCosta99/Graduation/tree/main/ThirdYear/FirstSemester/MNOnL) - Contains some scripts used in class.
    - [Deterministic Operations Research](https://github.com/pCosta99/Graduation/tree/main/ThirdYear/FirstSemester/MDIO) - Optimization problems using linear programming. This motivated me to use this type of approach in a work station scheduling problem and it turned out to make it a lot simpler.

    - [Computer Communications](https://github.com/pCosta99/Graduation/tree/main/ThirdYear/SecondSemester/CC) - Implemented a UDP protocol able to transfer files reliably with Java.
    - [Computer Graphics](https://github.com/pCosta99/Graduation/tree/main/ThirdYear/SecondSemester/CG) - Designed a solar system using OpenGL in C++.
    - [Computer Labs IV](https://github.com/pCosta99/Graduation/tree/main/ThirdYear/SecondSemester/LI4) - Implemented MentorMe, a website made with .NET that intended to shorten and simplify the capacity of teachers/colleagues answering each other doubts.
    - [Stochastic Operations Research](https://github.com/pCosta99/Graduation/tree/main/ThirdYear/SecondSemester/MEIO) - Implemented a car sales management model where uncertainty existed in terms of how many cars would be sold per day.
    - [Language Processing](https://github.com/pCosta99/Graduation/tree/main/ThirdYear/SecondSemester/PL) - Used tools such as Flex, Yacc and AWK to process files.
    - [Knowledge and Reasoning Representation Systems](https://github.com/pCosta99/Graduation/tree/main/ThirdYear/SecondSemester/SRCR) - Used Prolog to understand basic concepts leaning towards artificial intelligence.
