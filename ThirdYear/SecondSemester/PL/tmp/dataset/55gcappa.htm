<H1 align=center>The GEDCOM Standard Release 5.5</H1>
<H2 align=center> Appendix A</H2>
<br>
<B> Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Tag Definition</B>
<br>
<br>
<B> Introduction
<br>
</B>
<br>
Appendix A is a glossary of the tags used in the Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form. These tags are
used in a hierarchal structure to describe individuals in terms of their families, names, dates, places,
events, roles, sources, relationships.  Control information and other kinds of data intended for
computer processing is also included. (An example of the tags used in the Lineage-Linked Form
begins <a href=55gcch2.htm#Example>here</a> .) To ensure all transmitted information in the Lineage-Linked GEDCOM is
uniformly identified the standardized tags cannot be placed in any other context than shown in
<a href="55gcch2.htm">Chapter 2</a>.  It is legal to extend the context of the form, but only by using user-defined tags which
must begin with an underscore.  This will not violate the lineage-linked GEDCOM standard unless
the context for the grammar of the Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form is violated. The use of the
underscore in the user tag name is to signal a non-standard construct is being used. This notifies the
reading system of a discrepancy and will avoid future conflicts with tags that may be standardized in
subsequent GEDCOM releases.
<br>
<br>
